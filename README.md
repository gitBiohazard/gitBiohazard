### About me
I'm majoring in Information Systems and working as Front-end Developer.

My professional career in the area of technology and programming officially started in October 2020, when I started interning in the Infrastructure area and was promoted to Junior Infrastructure Technician. At the moment i'm a Programming Instructor and Front-end Developer.

Today I have solid knowledge in object-oriented programming, data structure and mobile with Ionic and Angular. Applied in different projects that are in a production environment, and that were programmed in Java, C# and PHP, integrated to MySQL and SQL Server databases. I developed the front-end of WebSites and complete systems in PHP7, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with responsiveness based on the Bootstrap 4 framework.
